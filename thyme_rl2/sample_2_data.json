The Python code will be executed by an external sandbox, and the processed image or result (wrapped in <sandbox_output></sandbox_output>) can be returned to aid your reasoning and help you arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Reasoning & Image Manipulation (Optional but Encouraged):**\n    * You have the capability to write executable Python code to perform image manipulations (e.g., cropping to a Region of Interest (ROI), resizing, rotation, adjusting contrast) or perform calculation for better reasoning.\n    * The code will be executed in a secure sandbox, and its output will be provided back to you for further analysis.\n    * All Python code snippets **must** be wrapped as follows:\n    <code>\n    ```python\n    # your code.\n    ```\n    </code>\n    * At the end of the code, print the path of the processed image (processed_path) or the result for further processing in a sandbox environment.",
